# Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

This file, and other associated files, make up my contribution to the final Peer Reviewed Assignment for the Coursera Capstone Project for Applied Data Science Capstone. This was my final module in the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate) programme.

For reference I include the original definition for each part of the assignment.

## Part 1

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always  target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a  problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and  why they would care about your problem.

This submission will eventually become your **Introduction / Business Problem**  section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report  (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your  Github repository and submit a link to it.

## Part 2

Describe the data that you will be  using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will  need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute  your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with  the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate  explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be  using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

This submission will eventually become your **Data** section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your **Data** section) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.



# Section 1: Introduction

In this section I will clearly define the idea of my choosing, where I leverage the Foursquare location data to solve the imagined business opportunity. 

## Background

There are 100's, maybe even 1000's, of travel sites on the Internet, including [FourSquare](www.foursquare.com), that will tell you all about places to go, things to see, restaurants to eat at, bars to drink in, nightclubs to part the night away in and then where to go in the morning to get breakfast and a strong coffee. The problems with these sites is that they are one dimensional. If you want to find out all this information about a city you plan to visit next month, **you** have to do the hard work. Also, just because a venue is the hottest place to go for a night out does not always mean that the unwitting tourist should just ramble in unprepared. The areas surrounding this new venue might be riddled with crime including muggings, car theft and assault, for example. Approach the venue from any direction other than from the north and you could be putting your life in danger. This is when my idea comes in.

Imagine the following scenario:

1. You are flying to Chicogo for a Data Science Conference.
2. You arrive in Chicago the day the conference starts but you've managed to convince your boss to delay your return by a few days giving you time to explore.
3. But you know no one in Chicago to show you around to all the top sites and to bring you to the best restaurants.
4. Also the last time you went to a conference you were mugged and had you passport. money and credit cards stolen so you're now nervous of going somewhere without first researching the venue and the surrounding area.
5. The conference is next week and you don't have time to do all the research you'd like.

**What do you do ... ?**

## Project Idea

My idea for the Capstone Project is to show that when driven by venue and location data from FourSquare, backed up with open source crime data, that it is possible to present the cautious and nervous traveller with a list of attractions to visit supplementd with a graphics showing the occurance of crime in the region of the venue.

A high level approach is as follows:

1. The travellers decides on a city location [in this case Chicago]
2. The ForeSquare website is scrapped for the top venues in the city
3. From this list of top venues the list is augmented with additional grographical data
4. Using this additional geographical data the top nearby restaurents are selects
5. The historical crime within a predetermined distance of all venues are obtained
6. A map is presented to the to the traveller showing the selected venues and crime statistics of the area. 

Now that the conference is over the Data Sceintist can explore Chigago and feel much safer.
